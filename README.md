#Secret Santa Style Gift Exchange Selector#

This is an app for shuffling names for gift exchanges (or
for anything else) in which you do not want a single person
knowing all the exchanges. The program allows you to input
names and associated email addresses. It pairs every giver
with a receiver and sends an email to each giver with whom
they should buy a gift for.

The program runs on GoogleAppEngine. A working (hopefully)
version can be found at
http://giftshuffler.appspot.com
